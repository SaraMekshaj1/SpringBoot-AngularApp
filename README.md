# Admin App

## Technologies used:
- Spring Boot
- Angular
- MySql
- Maven

 ## How It Works
 
User Interaction:
Users can create, view, update, and delete employee records through the Angular frontend.
Profile photos can be uploaded and viewed in Base64 format.

Data Flow:
The Angular app sends requests to the Spring Boot backend, which processes and stores data in MySQL.
The backend handles data operations and returns responses to the frontend.
